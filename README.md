# Cubot
a simple rubik's cube solver

the ui is fairly straightforward

hopefully you dont need help with that

built on tkinter and python


just download, unzip and run the .exe file


dont enter an invalid configuration or itll just crash (known issue)

dont try to run the executable outside its folder


android port coming soon based on kivy which will also be much faster and easier to use

will also post the source code of the older version when it does 

and yeah it was my first project, so dont expect a lot :)
